# Auto ARIMA Model

### 1. The Input Data was taken from Reliance Standalone Balance sheet for a period of 10 Years
### 2. We can forecast by the following methods
### 3. classical Decomposition , AUTO-ARIMA , VAR 
### VAR is an multivariate time series forecasting model and it was very advanced model and accurate in forecasting and at the same time   we can test the model and evaluate the model
### AUTO-ARIMA is an extension to classical decomomposition model and it wil automatically finds the the number of optimal regressive      lags and the moving average lags and the dfference part in the model and easy to implement and validate the model
### The final one was classical Decomposition model which it required mannual intervention to check the trend , seasonality and white      noise. This Model consists of several tests to validate and time consuming process and results are accurate in this model

### The VAR model was not giving promising results as the observations are relatively samll and need to process a lot to  get stationarity 

### I have used Auto-Arima since the model automatically finds the PDQ values and implements smoothly and easy to validate
